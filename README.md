# Snippets of Haskell

## What is this?
My first experience with functional programming. The goal was to think differently about coding or rather think of outside the box approaches to solving problems. Haskell is unique in the sense where it's a pure programming language -- no mutations, full use of recursion. The result is elegant and clean code. 

## Ownership of files
Please note that the lecture notes and assignments are property of Michael Vanier, instructor at The California Institute of Technology (Caltech). I will remove any of these files at anytime -- he has the right to those files. The programs however, are mine. In order to run these programs with the given test files (located in test_files), we simply just note the source of the test files, or drag these test files to the same directory path as the program.

## To Caltech students
You may only look at these assignments and solutions once you have completed the course / achieved the max score on one of the assignments. 

Please respect the Honor Code:
 > *No member of the Caltech community shall take unfair advantage of any other member of the Caltech community.* 

Thank you.
